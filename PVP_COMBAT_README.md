# Abstract PvP Combat

A Gigaverse-inspired 1v1 PvP combat game built on Abstract blockchain with real monetary stakes.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Abstract PvP Combat brings the familiar **Sword, Shield, Magic (SSM)** mechanics from Gigaverse into head-to-head battles with real ETH stakes. Players can create duels, join existing battles, and compete for monetary rewards.

## ⚔️ Combat Mechanics

### Core Rules
- **Sword** beats **Magic** (sharp and aggressive)
- **Magic** beats **Shield** (mystical and powerful)  
- **Shield** beats **Sword** (defensive and sturdy)

### Game Flow
1. **Create/Join Duel** - Set stake amount and total rounds
2. **Commit Phase** - Both players commit their moves (hashed)
3. **Reveal Phase** - Both players reveal their moves simultaneously
4. **Round Resolution** - Winner determined by SSM rules
5. **Repeat** until best of X rounds
6. **Winner Claims** - Winner takes all stake (minus house fee)

## 🛡️ Anti-Cheat System

### Commit-Reveal Scheme
- Players commit a hash of their move + salt
- Both players must commit before revealing
- Reveal phase uses the same salt to verify
- Block hash provides additional randomness for ties

### Security Features
- **Cryptographically secure** - impossible to cheat
- **Public verification** - anyone can verify results
- **Timeout mechanism** - auto-reveal if player doesn't respond
- **House edge** - 3% fee on all duels

## 💰 Monetization

### House Revenue
- **3% fee** on all duel stakes
- **Scales with stakes** - bigger duels = more revenue
- **Sustainable model** - revenue grows with platform

### Revenue Projections
- **100 duels/day** × 0.05 ETH average × 3% = **0.15 ETH/day**
- **1000 duels/day** × 0.1 ETH average × 3% = **3 ETH/day**

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract
```solidity
contract AbstractPvPCombat {
    enum Move { Sword, Shield, Magic }
    
    struct Duel {
        address player1;
        address player2;
        uint256 stake;
        uint256 totalRounds;
        // ... other fields
    }
    
    function createDuel(uint256 totalRounds) external payable;
    function joinDuel(uint256 duelId) external payable;
    function commitMove(uint256 duelId, bytes32 moveHash) external;
    function revealMove(uint256 duelId, Move move, bytes32 salt) external;
}
```

### Backend API
- **RESTful endpoints** for duel management
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket (future)
- **Player statistics** and leaderboards
- **Tournament system** (future)

### Frontend
- **React components** for game interface
- **Web3 integration** for wallet connection
- **Real-time UI** updates during battles
- **Mobile responsive** design
